## Introduction
Hi, I'm Peter Verheijen, and this is my personal website. 

I currently work as a Tech Lead MLOps at TMNL.

I’m passionate about leading teams, fostering collaboration, and creating environments where both individuals and the organization can thrive. My approach is driven by a deep sense of purpose—I strive to build spaces where people feel safe to ask questions, challenge assumptions, and grow together.

Colleagues often describe me as enthusiastic, communicative, and people-oriented. I combine strategic insight with hands-on leadership, always focused on helping teams succeed.

Here, I’ll be sharing articles about my experiences and approach as a Tech Lead, offering insights into leadership.

In addition, I’m exploring Rust from the perspective of a Python developer. If you’re a Pythonista interested in learning Rust, you’ll find a series of blog posts documenting my journey at [pythontorust.nl](https://pythontorust.nl).
