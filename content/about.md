My passion lies in leading teams, fostering collaboration, and ensuring that both individuals and the organization thrive. I am driven by purpose and aim to create environments where people feel safe to ask questions, challenge assumptions, and grow. Described by colleagues as enthusiastic, communicative, and people-oriented, I bring a blend of strategic insight and hands-on leadership to every role.

In my spare time, I'm diving into Rust from the perspective of a Pythonista, sharing my journey and insights with others who have a similar background.
