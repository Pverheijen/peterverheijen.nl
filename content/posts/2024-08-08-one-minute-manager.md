*The New One Minute Manager* by Ken Blanchard and Spencer Johnson introduces a simplified yet highly effective approach to leadership and management. The book emphasizes three core techniques that managers can use to guide their teams effectively while saving time: **One Minute Goals**, **One Minute Appraisals**, and **One Minute Redirects**.

## 1. One Minute Goals
This tool focuses on setting clear, concise goals that both the manager and the team member understand. The key idea is that each goal should be easily communicated and take only a minute to review. Here's how it works:

- **Clarity**: Both the manager and the employee agree on specific, measurable goals.
- **Simplicity**: Each goal should be no longer than a few sentences.
- **Frequent Review**: These goals should be reviewed regularly to ensure progress and alignment. The purpose is to ensure that both the employee and the manager are always on the same page regarding what success looks like and how it will be measured.

## 2. One Minute Appraisals (Also known as One Minute Praising)
This technique is about catching people doing things right and immediately recognizing their good work. Here's what it entails:

- **Immediate feedback**: As soon as the manager notices that an employee has done something well, they provide praise.
- **Specific praise**: The feedback should be precise about what the employee did well, not just a generic compliment.
- **Emphasize impact**: Along with praising the action, the manager also highlights how the employee's contribution positively affects the team or organization.

This method encourages positive reinforcement, boosting morale and productivity by reinforcing desirable behaviors.

## 3. One Minute Redirects
One Minute Redirects are used when things go wrong, but the idea is to correct the employeeâ€™s course quickly and constructively. This tool includes:

- **Immediate response**: When a mistake is noticed, the manager addresses it right away rather than letting it build up over time.
- **Specific focus**: Like with appraisals, feedback is specific. The manager explains what went wrong, how it affects the team or business, and what should be done differently next time.
- **Separate the person from the behavior**: The manager acknowledges that the person is still valued, but the specific behavior needs improvement. This reduces defensiveness and maintains trust.

Redirects are intended to correct behavior without damaging relationships, keeping the team on track toward shared goals.

These three tools create a structured yet flexible way to manage employees, promote accountability, and foster a positive work culture, all while being quick and efficient.
