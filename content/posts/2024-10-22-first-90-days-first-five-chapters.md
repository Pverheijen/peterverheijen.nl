Summary of first five chapters of *The First 90 Days, Updated and Expanded: Proven Strategies for Getting Up to Speed Faster and Smarter* by Michael Watkins.

### Chapter 1: **Prepare Yourself**
Stepping into a new role can be overwhelming, but the first step to succeeding in this transition is being mentally and strategically prepared before day one. This chapter focuses on the importance of positioning yourself correctly and making the mindset shift that will set you up for success.

- **Key Idea**: Transition is a process, and the first 90 days are crucial for your success. Preparation before starting a new role is key.
- **Strategy**: 
  - **Promote Yourself**: Shift your mindset from your old role to your new one. What worked before may not work now, so recognize the need to adapt.
  - **Accelerate Learning**: Start learning about your new role, organization, and industry even before day one. Learn the culture, key players, and unwritten rules.
  - **Align Expectations**: Set clear, realistic goals and expectations with your manager early to ensure alignment.

### Chapter 2: **Accelerate Your Learning**
This chapter dives into how critical it is to gather insights rapidly. The faster you understand the organization’s key challenges, opportunities, and the political landscape, the sooner you can make informed decisions. Learning should be structured and targeted to get the most out of your early days.

- **Key Idea**: Fast, focused learning is essential to succeed in a new role.
- **Strategy**: 
  - **Structured Learning**: Break down learning into categories—technical, cultural, political—and prioritize them.
  - **Use the 5C Framework**:
    - **Customers**: Understand who your key customers are, internal and external.
    - **Competitors**: Identify internal rivals and external competition.
    - **Culture**: Decode the organizational culture.
    - **Capabilities**: Identify key strengths and weaknesses within the organization.
    - **Conditions**: Understand the broader context in which your organization operates, such as market conditions and trends.
  - **Engage in Active Listening**: Use interviews and direct observation to gather information. Avoid forming premature conclusions.

### Chapter 3: **Match Strategy to Situation**
Not all leadership situations are the same. This chapter introduces the STARS framework, which outlines different types of organizational challenges. It highlights how your approach should vary depending on the specific situation you're entering.

- **Key Idea**: Different situations require different strategies. The STARS framework helps categorize your situation.
- **STARS Framework**:
  - **Start-up**: You're building something new.
  - **Turnaround**: You need to fix something broken.
  - **Accelerated Growth**: You need to scale up a successful operation.
  - **Realignment**: You need to reenergize a stagnant or drifting entity.
  - **Sustaining Success**: You need to maintain success in an already successful organization.
- **Strategy**: Adapt your leadership style and priorities to the specific situation you're facing. For example, in a turnaround, speed and decisiveness are critical, while in a sustaining success situation, you should maintain what works and only tweak minor aspects.

### Chapter 4: **Secure Early Wins**
Securing early wins is about making an immediate impact, building credibility, and generating momentum that can carry you through the rest of your transition. In this chapter, the focus is on identifying and executing small but meaningful changes that align with broader organizational goals.

- **Key Idea**: Early successes build credibility and momentum.
- **Strategy**:
  - **Identify Priorities**: Look for high-impact areas where you can deliver results early on. These should align with broader organizational goals.
  - **Get Buy-In**: Involve key stakeholders to ensure that early wins are recognized and celebrated.
  - **Plan for Quick Wins**: Select initiatives that you can realistically achieve in the first few months to demonstrate your ability to deliver.
  - **Communicate Results**: Publicize and share the impact of early successes to build your reputation and solidify your leadership.

### Chapter 5: **Negotiate Success**
The relationship you build with your manager during the transition is critical for your success. This chapter focuses on setting up a clear, mutually beneficial working relationship with your manager from the start by aligning expectations, establishing a rhythm for communication, and ensuring your progress is visible.

- **Key Idea**: Build an effective working relationship with your manager by setting expectations and fostering mutual trust.
- **Strategy**:
  - **Clarify Expectations**: Discuss with your manager what success looks like in your role and how your performance will be measured.
  - **Plan for Ongoing Communication**: Establish regular, structured check-ins to maintain alignment.
  - **Manage Up**: Proactively manage the relationship with your manager. Provide updates, seek feedback, and ensure that they are aware of your progress and challenges.
  - **Build Alliances**: Strengthen relationships with other key stakeholders who can support your success.
