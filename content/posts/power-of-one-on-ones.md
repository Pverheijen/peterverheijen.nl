One-on-one meetings are great for helping your team grow. Here's a quick way to structure these sessions around hard skills, soft skills, and personal goals.

## 1. Hard Skills: Building Technical Strength

Start by asking your mentee to list as many technical skills as they can think of. \
Then, help them pick 3 to 6 skills they want to focus on—ones that are a challenge and stretch their abilities. 

Next, draw a circle with 5 rings. \
Have them plot where they are now and where they want to be (1 = “I'm new at this,” 5 = “I could teach it”).

From that, choose one hard skill to work on and set some OKRs (Objectives and Key Results). Check in every two weeks to track progress.

## 2. Soft Skills: Growing Interpersonal Skills

Do the same for soft skills—things like communication, leadership, and time management. \
Have them choose 3 to 6 areas they want to improve and plot where they are on the circle.

Pick one soft skill to focus on, set OKRs, and review progress regularly.

## 3. Personal Goals: Supporting the Whole Person

Finally, ask your mentee to list personal goals, whether related to work-life balance, health, or hobbies. \
Have them pick a few to focus on and plot their progress using the same circle approach.

Choose one personal goal to work on, set some small goals, and check in every two weeks.

## Keep It Simple

This method gives structure to one-on-one meetings without overcomplicating things. Focus on progress, revisit goals often, and adjust as needed. It's all about continuous improvement!
