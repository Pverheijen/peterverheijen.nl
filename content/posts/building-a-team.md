Sharing your vision with your team.

Sharing a detailed vision for a department top down will most likely limit possibilities in terms of strategy. Giving an overview of a sense of direction and a sense of purpose might be enough. Deciding top down will limit people and give them the feeling that they are not or at least less involved (which is actually the case in that matter). You will get better results letting the team make decisions; they are closer to the problem than you are anyways.

People are generally good and want to do good things.

Keeping this in mind a valid strategy for building a team could be starting with people, then process will follow and lastly the goal will follow. Initially you will have to make sure that you get good people and that you nourish and support them. If they feel well and can make progress with a safety net; i.e., fail fast and fail forward. Then they will realize that they need a process to organize themselves more efficiently. From people, process will follow. Having people and process in place will result in progress.

1. People
2. Process
3. Progress

Give people positive feedback.

Recognition of good work inspires people to do more. Unexpectedly this is also and even more so the case for leaders. Leaders generally do not get positive feedback. A possible approach to building a performing team could be done by tackling the following things in this order:

1. Values
2. Vision
3. Mission

We go from things that are stable and should not change (values) to things that can change on a regular basis to achieve the vision (mission). A team should have clear values to outline their work and decisions. What is important and why do we care? What are we doing this for? We define a vision of what we believe the world should look like (a better place) if we succeed. Our mission is our plan in how to get there; it is the strategy to achieve our vision.

And on a last note; for career advancement patience is a virtue that pays out.

Being in a role where you are performing well gives you opportunity to try new things and develop yourself. People want you to succeed and you are in an environment and situation to try things and stumble without too much outfall. This will give you plenty of opportunity to grow and shine.
