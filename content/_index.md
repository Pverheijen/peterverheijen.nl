## Introduction

My passion lies in leading teams, fostering collaboration, and ensuring that both individuals and the organization thrive.
I am driven by purpose and aim to create environments where people feel safe to ask questions, challenge assumptions, and grow.
Described by colleagues as enthusiastic, communicative, and people-oriented, I bring a blend of strategic insight and hands-on leadership to every role.
